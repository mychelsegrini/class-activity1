This activity was developed in a class in the Institute of Technology and Leadership (Inteli) in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. It is basically a calculator of the average grade of a student that also shows if the student was APPROVED or REPROVED. It's that simple.

The project requires the library readline-sync, so that there may be input from the user.
